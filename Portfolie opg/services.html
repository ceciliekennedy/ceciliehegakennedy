                    Digital marketing is something i have been working with for 5 years with various companies and on my private social media. Digital marketing is a very exciting way to work with different target group and advertisements. <br> <br> I have been working mostly with social media as a SoMe Manager. I have worked mostly with finding the target group, fashion, trends, photos, filming and editing videoes.   </p>

                    Adobe XD is a vector based design tool for mobile apps and web apps. I've been introduced to Adobe at my school CPH Business Academy, where i study to become a Multimediedesigner. <br> <br> I love to work with XD because i find it very handy when you design a lot of diffrent things. I have designed mostly logos, moodboards and pictures in Adobe XD

                    Photoshop is the perfect tool when it comes to image editing, retouching, website mockups and adding effects.
